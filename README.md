# Research for layman

### Motivation
This repository aims to collectively create easily understandable materials for **Research Papers** that sometimes go beyond the reach of people who deserve to learn and sometimes it bounces off because of the weak subjective background in related topics. Arguing about a lack of understanding amongst some pool of engineers, while not providing them with the tools they require to develop such understanding is not gonna take us anywhere.

Research papers are meant to communicate ideas between experts, while this repository is an initiative to cross this barrier and make research content more exciting and understandable.

There is always more that could be done to help ensure that everyone gets a better understanding of research results.

My primary source of motivation are
1. [Stanford Scholar](https://scholar.stanford.edu/)| [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBVtJbn_LHUjqqGV30JVU1g).

2. [Two minute papers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg)



### In which media the content should be pushed to repo? Is there any defined format?

In my view videos are the best way to do this as stanford scholar has done so, but even blog post or either pdf would also do good. 

### Any specific domain to explain research papers for?

No, there is no specific domain. You can choose any domain you want. 

### Any specific Journal/Conference to explain research papers for?

No, you can choose any.

### Who would decide that the quality of the content explained is simple enough to understand and correct as described by research paper?

A set of reviewers from each domain will be asked to review the content. After a good feedback comes from reviewers, then only the PR will be merged.

### Who are those reviewers? 

For now it will be best people in my circle & gradually, I hope more people starts to contribute & review.

### What if someone explains wrong? Who would be responsible for that crap?

It's an open research effort and nobody is liable for any crap. Even if somethings are explained wrong, Issues can be raised against a particular research paper, discussed , reviewed again and therefore edits can be made.

### How should I start?

Just submit a PR for the paper you are targetting along with the explaination in the following way.

* If the explaination is in pdf, then commit along with two files paper.pdf and explaination.pdf
* If the explaination is a blog post just mail me the web link along with the commit ID of your commit that has pushed paper.pdf

### Can I be reviewer as well as contributor?

Yes
