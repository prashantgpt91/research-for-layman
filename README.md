# Research-for-layman

## Motivation
This repository aims to collectively create easily understandable materials for **Research Papers** that sometimes go beyond the reach of people who deserve to learn and sometimes it bounces off because of the weak subjective background in related topics.
Exclaiming about a lack of understanding amongst some pool of engineers, while not providing them with the tools they require to develop such understanding is not gonna take us anywhere.

There is always more that could be done to help ensure that everyone gets a better understanding of research results.

My primary source of motivation is [Stanford Scholar](https://scholar.stanford.edu/). 

## In what mode the content should be pushed to repo? Is there any defined format?

In my view videos are the best way to do this as stanford scholar has proved so, but even blog post/Doc/pdf/txt would also do good.
No, there is no defined format yet & there will be none. I don't want people to pull back just because of so much of formatting rules.
I will start this as my individual effort but will be happy to see other people joining in. So PRs are welcome.
